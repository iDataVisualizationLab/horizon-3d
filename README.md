# horizon-3d

The project aims to study perception of human to some common 3D representations such as: normal surface graph, horizon graph and small multiples.
 These representations are well known in 2D visualization in the form of: line graph, horizon graph and small multiple graphs. The concepts are almost 
  similar in 3D representation. However each representation may gain different effect regarding to certain use case.
